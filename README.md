## Usage

### Initialization

This library uses [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) to perform symbolic calculations. It's convenient to import it as `sp` and define frequently used constants for future use.

```python
import sympy as sp

i = sp.I
pi = sp.pi
sqrt2 = sp.sqrt(2)
```

When using this library in Jupyter Notebook, call [`init_printing`](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/printing.html#setting-up-pretty-printing) to enable pretty printing.

```python
sp.init_printing()
```

### EWL instance

First, you need to define the initial (preferably entangled) quantum state:

```python
from sympy.physics.quantum.qubit import Qubit

psi = (Qubit('00') + i * Qubit('11')) / sqrt2
```

It is also necessary to define two unitary strategies that represent the classical strategies:

```python
C = sp.Matrix([
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1],
])

D = sp.Matrix([
    [0, i],
    [i, 0],
])
```

Then you need to define the players' strategies. Each strategy must be a unitary matrix as it represents a single-qubit quantum gate.

```python
alice = sp.Matrix([
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1],
])
```

The library comes with a series of built-in parametrizations, including the original one from EWL paper as well as other 2- and 3 degrees of freedom parametrizations (see [here](https://github.com/tomekzaw/ewl/blob/master/src/ewl/parametrizations.py)).

```python
from ewl.parametrizations import *

bob = U_Eisert_Wilkens_Lewenstein(theta=pi / 2, phi=0)
```

At this point you can also use arbitrary symbols and compound expressions to generalize the analysis.

```python
theta, gamma = sp.symbols('theta gamma', real=True)

charlie = U_Eisert_Wilkens_Lewenstein(theta=theta, phi=gamma / 2)
```

You also need to define the payoff matrix, possibly with symbols, for arbitrary number of players.

```python
payoff_matrix = sp.Array([
    [
        [3, 5],
        [0, 1],
    ],
    [
        [3, 0],
        [5, 1],
    ],
])
```

Finally, you can make an instance of quantum game in the EWL protocol by providing the initial quantum state, a list of players' strategies and the payoff matrix with corresponding shape. The library supports arbitrary number of players, although it works best for 2-player games.

```python
from ewl import EWL

ewl = EWL(psi=psi, C=C, D=D, strategies=[alice, bob], payoff_matrix=payoff_matrix)
```

### Calculations

Based on the provided initial quantum state, the library automatically calculates the corresponding matrix of *J* and *J*<sup>â€ </sup> gates.

```python
ewl.J
ewl.J_H
```

Based on the players' strategies, the library also calculates the amplitudes of the result quantum state in the computational basis.

```python
ewl.amplitudes()
ewl.amplitudes(simplify=False)
```

From the amplitudes one can easily derive the probabilities of possible game results. By default, the expressions are simplified using trigonometric identities. Make sure to enable `real=True` flag when defining real-valued symbols to allow for further simplification.

```python
ewl.probs()
ewl.probs(simplify=False)
```

Finally, based on the payoff matrix and previously mentioned probabilities, the library calculates the payoff functions as symbolic expressions (possibly with parameters from the initial state and strategies).

```python
ewl.payoff_function(player=0)  # first player
ewl.payoff_function(player=1, simplify=False)  # second player
ewl.payoff_function(player=None)  # payoff sum
```

For quantum games parametrized with exactly two symbols, it is possible to plot a three-dimensional graph of the payoff function.

```python
from ewl.plotting import plot_payoff_function

plot_payoff_function(
    ewl, player=0,
    x=alpha, x_min=0, x_max=pi / 2,
    y=beta, y_min=0, y_max=pi / 2)
```

### Parameters

Here's how you can list all symbols used either in the initial quantum state or in the players' strategies:

```python
ewl.params
```

You can also substitute the symbols with specific values to obtain a non-parametrized instance of quantum game as new EWL instance:

```python
ewl_fixed = ewl.fix(theta=0, gamma=pi / 2)
```

### Qiskit integration

This library also integrates with [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/), allowing arbitrary quantum games in the EWL protocol to be executed on [IBM Q](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/) devices. First, you need to load your credentials:

```python
from qiskit import IBMQ

IBMQ.load_account()
```

When running locally, make sure to save the access token to disk first using [`IBMQ.save_account`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQFactory.save_account.html).

In order to access backend-specific features of EWL instance, first you need to convert it to `EWL_IBMQ` instance. Note that the input quantum game must be non-parametrized (cannot have any symbols).

```python
from ewl.ibmq import EWL_IBMQ

ewl_ibmq = EWL_IBMQ(ewl_fixed)
```

You can also specify and apply noise model used in quantum simulation.

```python
from qiskit.providers.aer.noise import NoiseModel, pauli_error

p_error = 0.05
bit_flip = pauli_error([('X', p_error), ('I', 1 - p_error)])
phase_flip = pauli_error([('Z', p_error), ('I', 1 - p_error)])

noise_model = NoiseModel()
noise_model.add_all_qubit_quantum_error(bit_flip, ['u1', 'u2', 'u3'])
noise_model.add_all_qubit_quantum_error(phase_flip, ['x'], [0])

ewl_ibmq = EWL_IBMQ(ewl_fixed, noise_model=noise_model)
```

You can draw the original quantum circuit of quantum game in the EWL protocol.

```python
ewl_ibmq.draw()
```

It is also possible to draw the quantum circuit transpiled for a specific backend.

```python
ewl_ibmq.draw_transpiled(backend_name='ibmq_quito', optimization_level=3)
```

Here's how you can execute the quantum game on a specific statevector simulator:

```python
ewl_ibmq.simulate_probs(backend_name='statevector_simulator')
```

You may also run the quantum circuit on QASM simulator and get histogram data of the experiment.

```python
ewl_ibmq.simulate_counts(backend_name='qasm_simulator')
```

Finally, you can run the quantum game on a real quantum device:

```python
ewl_ibmq.run(backend_name='ibmq_quito', optimization_level=3)
```
